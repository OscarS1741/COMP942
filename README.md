### Comp 942 Solo Algorithm Projects

- This repository contains folders with coding projects of each student

# Important Note for Classmates: 
If you never used GitHub or git before, upload your first project via UI (browser). 

Go to "Create new file" or "Upload files" and for the name type the following (the way it is in italics):

*/firstLastName *

then, 

*yourfileName* and type (for example, .js, .py, .c) depending on the language you chose. 

For folders, files, etc. we are using lowerCamelCase style to stay consistent. 

Once you do that, edit README and add your project along with your name in the next section. 

Thank you :)
Alice
